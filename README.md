# üåç Green Shift - Carbon Footprint Tracker with Climate Change Insights

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with profound 
consequences for the environment, economy, and society. Human activities, 
particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have 
significantly contributed to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the 
atmosphere. These activities have led to global warming, rising sea levels, and extreme 
weather conditions. In this context, it is essential to raise awareness and encourage 
individual contributions toward mitigating climate change.

The **_Green Shift_ - Carbon Footprint Tracker with Climate Change Insights** project aims 
to empower individuals to take actionable steps by providing them with a platform to 
track their personal carbon footprints. It bridges the gap between individual awareness 
and tangible environmental impact by enabling users to visualize their contributions to 
carbon emissions. By using machine learning models, the system predicts future carbon 
footprints and offers personalized recommendations for adopting sustainable habits. 
Furthermore, real-time integration with climate API Climate Track which ensures the 
delivery of accurate and insightful data. This initiative not only highlights the 
importance of personal accountability but also serves as a stepping stone toward a more 
sustainable future.

# Project Description

## Technological Stack 
> ‚Ä¢ Programming Language: Python (for backend and machine learning models).
<br> ‚Ä¢ Framework: Streamlit for user interface development.
<br> ‚Ä¢ Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (data processing), Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations).
<br> ‚Ä¢ Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, ARIMA/LSTM for time series analysis, and K-Means Clustering.

## Innovative Features 
> ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Insights: Real-time integration of climate data offers users a unique perspective on global and local trends.
<br> ‚Ä¢ Predictive Analytics: Advanced machine learning algorithms forecast future scenarios, motivating proactive behavior.
<br> ‚Ä¢ Behavioral Customization: Personalized recommendations adapt to individual lifestyles, ensuring higher user engagement.

## Illustrative Use Case 
> **A user inputs details:** ‚ÄúDrives 50 km daily (petrol), consumes 10 kWh of electricity (non-renewable), and eats meat 5 times a week.‚Äù 
<br> **Output:** The platform calculates their total emissions, categorizes them as ‚ÄúModerate Impact,‚Äù and suggests using public transport, adopting a plant-based diet, and installing solar panels.
<br> **Visualization:** A graph displays their current emissions, projected reductions from recommendations, and comparisons with average footprints globally an in India.

## Summary 
> The Green Shift project bridges the gap between awareness and actionable insights by 
combining user-friendly design with robust machine learning models. Its modular 
approach ensures scalability and adaptability, making it a comprehensive tool for 
addressing individual contributions to climate change.
